Assignment 2 - Data Mining

In this assignment we were asked to do the following:


1. Implement the k-means clustering algorithm to cluster the instances into k
clusters.

2. Implement the k-medians clustering algorithm to cluster the instances into k
clusters.

3. Run the k-means clustering algorithm you implemented in part (1) to cluster
the given instances. Vary the value of k from 1 to 9 and compute the B-CUBED precision,
recall, and F-score for each set of clusters. Plot k in the horizontal axis and the B-CUBED
precision, recall and F-score in the vertical axis in the same plot.

4. Now re-run the k-means clustering algorithm you implemented in part (1)
but normalise each object (vector) to unit `2 length before clustering. Vary the value of
k from 1 to 9 and compute the B-CUBED precision, recall, and F-score for each set of
clusters. Plot k in the horizontal axis and the B-CUBED precision, recall and F-score in
the vertical axis in the same plot.

5. Run the k-medians clustering algorithm you implemented in part (2) over
the unnormalised objects. Vary the value of k from 1 to 9 and compute the B-CUBED
precision, recall, and F-score for each set of clusters. Plot k in the horizontal axis and the
B-CUBED precision, recall and F-score in the vertical axis in the same plot.

6. Now re-run the k-medians clustering algorithm you implemented in part (2)
but normalise each object (vector) to unit `2 length before clustering. Vary the value of
k from 1 to 9 and compute the B-CUBED precision, recall, and F-score for each set of
clusters. Plot k in the horizontal axis and the B-CUBED precision, recall and F-score in
the vertical axis in the same plot.

7. Comparing the different clusterings you obtained in (3)-(6), discuss in which
setting you obtained best clustering for this dataset.
